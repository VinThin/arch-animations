> "Read this GSAP_Architecture_Flow_Style_Guide.md file and create a similar interactive architecture flow diagram for [YOUR NEW WORKFLOW]. Follow all the styling, animation patterns, and design principles outlined in the guide."
The guide is comprehensive enough that an LLM can recreate the exact look, feel, and functionality of your current animations while adapting the content for any new technical workflow or architecture diagram.# arch-animations
