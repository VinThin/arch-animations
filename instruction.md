Use context 7 and refer the documentation of GSAP and create a very simple diagram where messages appear in the left side into Postgres table and from Postgres it goes into Debyzium and from Debyzium it goes into Kafka and from Kafka it is read by a SparkStream job and the data enters Databricks. Can you build a very small animation using the GSAP library? I want to see the possibility of it.
